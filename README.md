# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Moritz

I'm a creative technologist and designer with a strong foundation in computational design, parametric modeling, and digital fabrication. Based in Germany, I bridge architecture, robotics, and software to develop future-ready workflows and tools.

##  What I Do
-  **Parametric Design & Automation**  
  Building Grasshopper workflows for architecture, engineering, and large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM).

-  **Robotic 3D Printing**  
  Working with industrial robotic arms (KUKA, DXR25, etc.) and pellet-based extrusion systems for prototyping and 1:1 architectural applications.

-  **Process Digitization for SMEs**  
  Through [PARAMETRIC.solutions](https://www.parametricsolutions.de), I help businesses in AEC and manufacturing rethink their processes and adopt digital strategies.

-  **Teaching & Empowering Students**  
  Promoting hands-on access to digital tools at FH MÃ¼nster, including robotic fabrication, simulation workflows, and integrated CAD/CAM processes.

##  Tools & Tech
- Rhino + Grasshopper
- GCode generation
- Digital fabrication (robotics, 3D printing)
- Open-source tooling for fabrication-ready geometry
- Real-time robotic simulation + slicing in Grasshopper


##  Currently Exploring
- MATLAB integration
- Python (GH Python, scripting, simulation integration)
- AI-assisted layout generation for retail design
