# 👋 Hi, I’m Moritz

I'm a creative technologist and designer with a strong foundation in computational design, parametric modeling, and digital fabrication. Based in Germany, I bridge architecture, robotics, and software to develop future-ready workflows and tools.

## 🔧 What I Do
- 🏗️ **Parametric Design & Automation**  
  Building Grasshopper workflows for architecture, engineering, and large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM).

- 🤖 **Robotic 3D Printing**  
  Working with industrial robotic arms (KUKA, DXR25, etc.) and pellet-based extrusion systems for prototyping and 1:1 architectural applications.

- 📊 **Process Digitization for SMEs**  
  Through [PARAMETRIC.solutions](https://www.parametricsolutions.de), I help businesses in AEC and manufacturing rethink their processes and adopt digital strategies.

- 🎓 **Teaching & Empowering Students**  
  Promoting hands-on access to digital tools at FH Münster, including robotic fabrication, simulation workflows, and integrated CAD/CAM processes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- Rhino + Grasshopper
- Python (GH Python, scripting, simulation integration)
- GCode generation
- Robots Plugin for Grasshopper
- MATLAB integration
- JSON workflows for data exchange
- Digital fabrication (robotics, 3D printing, laser scanning)

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- AI-assisted layout generation for retail design
- Real-time robotic simulation + slicing in Grasshopper
- Open-source tooling for fabrication-ready geometry
